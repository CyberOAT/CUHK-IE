When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.\"},{\"id\":\"painting\",\"featureImageUrl\":\"painting.jpg\",\"title\":\"Do you like drawing?\",\"description\":\"Painting is an important form in the visual arts\",\"content\":\"Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface.
